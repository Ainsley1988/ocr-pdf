    "2. Place your files in the `todo` folder\n",
    "   - Those by themselves will just be converted\n",
    "   - Those inside subfolders will also be merged in alphabetical order\n",
    "3. Share the outer `pdf` folder with this notebook\n",
    "   - Zip the folder\n",
    "   - Open this notebook in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ipitio/ocr-pdf/blob/master/colab.ipynb)\n",
